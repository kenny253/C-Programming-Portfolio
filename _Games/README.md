// C Programming Portfolio: Interactive Game Suite

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of console-based games and utility programs developed in C. It demonstrates a clear progression in software engineering proficiency, transitioning from foundational procedural scripts (v1) to advanced, modular, and data-driven applications (v2).

---

// Project Overview

The programs in this suite cover a wide range of computer science fundamentals, including:
* **Memory Management**: Utilizing pointers and arrays for dynamic data handling.
* **Data Structures**: Implementing `structs` and `enums` to organize complex information.
* **Persistent Storage**: Using File I/O to save user progress and high scores.
* **Defensive Programming**: Advanced input validation and buffer management.
* **Game Logic**: State machines, randomization, and timed execution.

// Portfolio Contents

// Memorization & Pattern Recognition
* **Memorization Challenge (v1 & v2)**: A number recall game that tests short-term memory through timed display windows and variable difficulty tiers.
* **Word Search Game (v1 & v2)**: A pattern recognition challenge requiring users to find hidden substrings within randomized character grids.
* **Concentration Game**: A specialized memory exercise focused on sequence retention and recall.

// Mathematics & Logic
* **Simple Calculation Game (v1 & v2)**: A mental math trainer featuring multi-operation support (addition, subtraction, multiplication) and persistent high-score tracking.
* **Math Quiz Game**: An interactive arithmetic assessment tool with dynamic problem generation.
* **The Number Counter**: A utility program demonstrating iteration logic and controlled loops.

// Probability & Trivia
* **Simple Dice Game (v1 & v2)**: A simulation of Craps that highlights multi-stage game logic and pointer-based value passing.
* **Trivia Game (v1 & v2)**: A categorized quiz system evolved from hard-coded functions to a scalable, struct-based database.
* **Guessing Game**: A classic logic game utilizing binary search principles to narrow down randomized values.

// Technical Evolution

This portfolio specifically highlights the "v1 to v2" refactoring process, showcasing improvements in:

1. **Modularity**: Moving logic out of `main()` and into specialized, reusable functions.
2. **Portability**: Replacing OS-specific headers (like `<windows.h>`) with standard C libraries for cross-platform compatibility.
3. **User Experience**: Implementing clean menus, real-time feedback, and robust error handling for invalid inputs.

// How to Compile and Run

// Requirements
* A standard C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

// Compilation Example
To compile any program (e.g., Memorization Challenge v2), use:
`gcc "Memorization Challenge v2.c" -o mem_game`

// Execution
`./mem_game`

// Portfolio Statement

Although am still a beginner:
As a developer, I believe that software should be both efficient and maintainable. This portfolio reflects my journey in mastering the C language, starting with the basic syntax and advancing toward professional software design patterns. Each "Version 2" update represents my commitment to code quality, emphasizing the importance of functional decomposition, documentation, and creating a seamless interface for the end-user.
