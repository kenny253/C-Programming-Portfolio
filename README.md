This repository documents my journey and progress in learning C programming. The projects and assignments here represent my early steps in programming and demonstrate my growing understanding of fundamental concepts. My goal is to showcase my dedication and passion for problem-solving, as I learn to apply theoretical knowledge to build practical applications.

Key Skills I'm Learning and Demonstrating
This portfolio highlights my initial grasp of several core programming areas:

Fundamentals: Understanding basic data types, control flow, and functions.

Data Structures: Using arrays and structs to organize data.

Memory Management: Learning to use pointers and dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free) to manage memory effectively.

Modular Programming: Breaking down larger problems into smaller, manageable functions.

Problem-Solving: Developing simple projects and games from scratch to build my skills.

My First Projects:
These projects and games were challenging and exciting to build. They represent key milestones in my learning journey:

Simple ATM Simulator:

My first larger project, designed to handle basic banking transactions and user input. It was a great way to practice using functions and conditional logic.

Memorization Challenge:

I created this game to challenge myself with timers and more complex user interaction, and it helped me understand how to manage game state.

Student GPA Calculator:

This project taught me how to handle and process numerical data, as well as how to read and write to files.

Simple Phonebook:

This was an important step in learning how to work with strings and file I/O to create a simple, useful application.

Simple Dice Game:

My very first game! This helped me understand how to use randomization and basic conditional logic to create a fun, interactive program.

Repository Structure:
I've organized my code into folders to keep everything neat and easy to navigate. Each folder represents a specific topic or type of project:

Arrays: Projects focused on array manipulation.

Basics and Algorithms: My earliest work with foundational concepts.

Cryptography: Simple programs to explore basic encryption and decryption ideas.

Data Structures: My first attempts at implementing common data structures.

Dynamic Memory Allocation: Programs that specifically use dynamic memory.

Function Prototypes and Definitions: Examples of how I'm learning to organize my code.

Games: Fun, interactive projects.

Pointers: Programs focused on understanding and using pointers.

Projects: More complex applications I've built.

Strings: My work with string manipulation and operations.


How to Compile and Run a Project:
To execute these programs, you will need a C compiler like GCC installed on your computer. The code cannot be run directly on GitHub.

Step 1: Get the Code
First, clone the entire repository to your local machine using the following Git command in your terminal:

git clone [https://github.com/kenny253/C-Programming-Portfolio.git](https://github.com/kenny253/C-Programming-Portfolio.git)

Step 2: Navigate and Compile
Use the cd (change directory) command to navigate to the specific project folder you wish to run. Then, compile the C source file into a runnable program using GCC.

cd C-Programming-Portfolio/your_project_name
gcc your_program_name.c -o program

Step 3: Run the Program
Finally, run the new program executable that was just created.

./program

The program's output will appear directly in your terminal.

Notes:

Some programs, like "Reading the Data of a File Using IO", rely on specific data files like students.dat and hobby.dat. Make sure these are located in the same folder as the C source code.

Comments within the code itself provide further details on functionality and logic.

Thank you for your interest in my work.
