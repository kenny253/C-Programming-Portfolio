// Games in C Programming

This section contains simple games and interactive programs created in the C programming language.  
Each project focuses on building logic, working with user input, applying loops, and managing program flow â€” essential skills for both beginners and aspiring software developers.


// Overview

Game development in C helps reinforce programming concepts like:
- **Conditionals** (if, else, switch)
- **Loops** (for, while, do-while)
- **Random number generation** (using `rand()` and `srand()`)
- **User interaction** (via keyboard input and formatted output)
- **Score tracking and logic testing**

These projects demonstrate how basic C principles can be applied to make programs both functional and engaging.


// Programs Included

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Concentration Game.c** | A memory challenge where players must recall numbers displayed briefly on the screen. |
| **Guessing Game.c** | The computer selects a random number and the player guesses until correct, receiving hints along the way. |
| **Math Quiz Game.c** | A quiz that tests quick math recall with randomly generated arithmetic problems. |
| **Memorization Challenge.c** | Expands on memory testing through timed number sequences and user accuracy tracking. |
| **Simple Calculation Game.c** | A mini calculator-style challenge where users perform math operations interactively. |
| **Simple Dice Game.c** | Simulates rolling dice and compares results for a simple competitive experience. |
| **The Number Counter.c** | Involves counting logic and loop-based control flow for simple number prediction or tracking. |
| **Trivia Game.c** | A question-and-answer game that introduces multi-option input and conditional responses. |
| **Word Search Game.c** | A basic text-based word finder that uses string comparison to locate hidden words. |
| **Word Search Game v2.c** | An improved version of the word search with added logic and cleaner user experience. |


// How to Compile and Run

Each game can be compiled using GCC or any C compiler:

```bash
gcc "Guessing Game.c" -o guessing_game
./guessing_game
