// Basics and Algorithms in C

This folder contains foundational programs that demonstrate essential programming concepts in C, along with basic algorithmic implementations.  
The goal of these examples is to strengthen understanding of program logic, control flow, data manipulation, and the fundamentals of sorting algorithms.



// Concepts Covered
- User input and data validation  
- Type casting and data conversion  
- Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, nested loops)  
- Basic sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort)  
- Implementing user-interactive programs



// Programs

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Basic Bubble Sort.c** | Demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers in ascending order. |
| **User-Interactive Bubble Sort.c** | Enhances the Bubble Sort example by allowing users to input custom data for sorting. |
| **Loop Control Statements.c** | Illustrates the use of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, including control statements such as `break` and `continue`. |
| **Manipulating User Input with fgets Demo.c** | Demonstrates how to safely handle and process user input using `fgets()` to avoid buffer overflow. |
| **Type Casting Demo.c** | Shows how to convert between different data types and explains implicit vs. explicit casting. |

// How to Compile and Run

Each file can be compiled and executed individually using a C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc "Basic Bubble Sort.c" -o bubble_sort
./bubble_sort
