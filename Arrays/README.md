# Arrays in C

This folder contains programs that demonstrate the use of arrays in C programming, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, initialization, user input, and basic searching techniques.

Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store multiple values of the same type under a single variable name.



// Concepts Covered
- Declaring and initializing arrays
- Accessing array elements using indices
- Working with character arrays (strings)
- Performing linear search
- Using two-dimensional arrays (matrices)



// Programs

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Basic Array Initialization.c | Demonstrates how to create and initialize an array of integers, then display its contents. |
| Character Array Initialization.c | Shows how character arrays work and how strings are represented in C. |
| User-Validated Array Indexing.c | Ensures safe access to array elements by validating user input. |
| Linear Search in Array.c | Implements a simple linear search algorithm to find an element in an array. |
| 2D Array Search.c | Demonstrates how to create and search within a two-dimensional array. |



// How to Compile and Run

Each file can be compiled and executed individually using a C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc "Linear Search in Array.c" -o linear_search
./linear_search
